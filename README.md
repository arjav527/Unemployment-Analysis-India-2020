# 📊 Unemployment Analysis in India (2020)

This data science project explores unemployment trends across Indian states from January to November 2020. The goal is to understand how unemployment evolved over time, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, using real-world data and advanced visualizations.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze unemployment rate changes over time and by region
- Visualize key trends using line charts, heatmaps, and bar graphs
- Create an interactive animated map to show how unemployment moved geographically
- Identify regions most affected by economic slowdown
- Suggest future scope for predictive modeling

- 🏙️ **Urban areas** showed greater volatility compared to rural areas
- 🛑 States like **Tripura, Haryana, and Delhi** had the **highest unemployment rates**
- ✅ **Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Gujarat** showed more stable trends
- 🔍 No strong correlation between unemployment rate and labor participation
- 🌐 **Animated maps** showed unemployment shifting dynamically over months

## 🔮 Future Scope

With more detailed socio-economic data (GDP, literacy rate, industry type), this project can be extended to build:

- 📈 Predictive Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- ⏳ Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
- 📍 Geo-spatial heatmaps for policy recommendations
